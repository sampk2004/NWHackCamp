          "Earthsave Canada is a Vancouver, BC based charity since 1989. We advocate the move toward a more whole food, plant-based diet for environmental sustainability, better health, and compassion toward animals. A plant-based diet can provide all the nutrients you need and can help prevent cancer, heart disease, diabetes and other illnesses. A diet heavy in animal products is simply not sustainable. Animal agriculture is very inefficient and causes significant environmental damage. Animals are living, breathing and feeling beings, just like us. Using them for food is unnecessary, as we can live happy and healthy lives on a plant-based diet.",
